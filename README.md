# Wordle
Class for generating ideal guesses in NYT Wordle game

We will use the list of valid 5 letter words from:
https://gist.github.com/dracos/dd0668f281e685bad51479e5acaadb93

We will also use the wordfreq package available via pip install
to find the usage of potential guesses to better predict the final
word.
